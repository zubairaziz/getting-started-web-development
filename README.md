# Getting Started With Web Development

## Prerequisites

<details>
  <summary>git</summary>
  <p>Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.</p>
  <p>First, you want to get git installed on your system. Here's how to do it for different platforms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mac:</strong> <code>brew install git</code></li>
    <li><strong>PC:</strong> <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank">gitforwindows.org</a></li>
    <li><strong>Linux:</strong> You know what to do</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then, let's set up your git credentials so your commits can be tied to your account and have it saved on your machine.</p>
  <pre>
  $ git config --global user.email "yourgithubemail"
  $ git config --global user.name "yourfullname"
  $ git config --global credential.helper cache --timeout=31536000  // sets timeout to 1 year
  </pre>

<details>
  <summary>text editor</summary>
  <p>A text editor or your internal development environment (IDE) is where you'll spend most of your time in as a developer. You'll be using it to edit all the files that you'll be working with for all your projects.</p>
  <p>I would highly recommend Visual Studio Code, a free and open-source code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. I will also list out other text editors that you might want to try out.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"></a>Notepad++</li>
  </ul>
